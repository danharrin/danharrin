I am a full-stack Laravel developer, working heavily with the TALL stack. I work for [Stagent](https://stagent.com) as Lead Developer, building an innovative new booking platform for artists in the music industry!

### ðŸ“¦ I'm currently working on...
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com), a collection TALL stack packages for Laravel artisans, with [Ryan Scherler](https://github.com/ryanscherler) and [Ryan Chandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler).
- The [TALL Preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall) with [Liam Hammett](https://github.com/imliam) and [Ryan Chandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler), which has now been used over 70,000 times by developers who need a jumpstart into their next TALL stack project.
- [Squire](https://github.com/squirephp/squire), a library of static Eloquent models for common fixture data such as countries and currencies.
- [Envault](https://github.com/envault/envault), a tool for securely sharing .env credentials with your team.
