I am a full-stack Laravel developer, working heavily with the TALL stack.

üì¶ I'm currently working on...
- [Envault](https://envault.dev), a tool for sharing .env credentials with your team.
- The [TALL Preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall) with [Liam Hammett](https://github.com/imliam) and [Ryan Chandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler), which has now been used over 20,000 times by developers who need a jumpstart into their next TALL stack project.
- [Squire](https://github.com/danharrin/squire), a library of static Eloquent models for common fixture data such as countries and currencies.
- A tech podcast called [Undefined Variable](https://undefined-variable.transistor.fm), where we discuss topics that interest us and the community. [You can check out the first episode here](https://undefined-variable.transistor.fm/1)!

ü§ù I also make direct open-source contributions to projects such as [Laravel Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) and [October CMS](https://github.com/octobercms/october), and I'm very active within the developer community. I manage the [Laravel Livewire Discord server](https://discord.gg/livewire), and answer questions on various other platforms as well.

üí´ I also post [quick tips on Twitter](https://twitter.com/danjharrin), often about unknown TALL stack techniques that I discover and use in my own apps. I've recently started creating [video tutorials on YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCXpwqLsgBnot6Qz9swdlbZA): my first explained how to create a custom select input with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS, and I'd love to complete a series with other useful custom form components such as phone number inputs, address autocompletes, and date-time pickers.
