I am a full-stack Laravel developer, working heavily with the TALL stack.

### ðŸ“¦ I'm currently working on...
- [Envault](https://github.com/envault/envault), a tool for securely sharing .env credentials with your team.
- The [TALL Preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall) with [Liam Hammett](https://github.com/imliam) and [Ryan Chandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler), which has now been used over 30,000 times by developers who need a jumpstart into their next TALL stack project.
- [Squire](https://github.com/danharrin/squire), a library of static Eloquent models for common fixture data such as countries and currencies.
- A tech podcast called [Undefined Variable](https://undefined-variable.transistor.fm), where we discuss topics that interest us and the community. [You can check out the first episode here](https://undefined-variable.transistor.fm/1)!
- [YouTube video tutorials](https://youtube.com/channel/UCXpwqLsgBnot6Qz9swdlbZA): my first explained how to create a custom select input with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS.
